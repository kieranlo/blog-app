<p>Date: July 2 2025</p>
<h2 id="perception-of-work" node="[object Object]">Perception of Work</h2>
<p>Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don&#x27;t let &quot;work&quot; mean something other people tell you to do.</p>
<h2 id="work-on-things-that-spark-your-curiosity" node="[object Object]">Work on things that spark your curiosity</h2>
<p>What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</p>
<h2 id="four-steps" node="[object Object]">Four steps</h2>
<p>Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who&#x27;s done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.</p>
<p>Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s essential to work on something you&#x27;re deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-doing-great-work-difficult" node="[object Object]">Why is doing great work difficult</h2>
<p>The main reason it&#x27;s hard is that you can&#x27;t tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: <strong>you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it.</strong> And in the meantime you&#x27;re not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information.</p>
<p>The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.</p>
<h2 id="false-portrayal-of-the-educational-systems" node="[object Object]">False portrayal of the educational systems</h2>
<p>The educational systems in most countries pretend it&#x27;s easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it&#x27;s really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.</p>
<p>It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can&#x27;t do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you&#x27;ll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don&#x27;t tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you&#x27;re on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.</p>
<h2 id="act-now" node="[object Object]">Act now</h2>
<p>What should you do if you&#x27;re young and ambitious but don&#x27;t know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who&#x27;ve done great work, it&#x27;s remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions</p>
<h2 id="how-to-start-" node="[object Object]">How to start?</h2>
<p>When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they&#x27;re like. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s probably not for you.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry if you find you&#x27;re interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you&#x27;ll be productive. And you&#x27;re more likely to find new things if you&#x27;re looking where few have looked before.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re making something for people, make sure it&#x27;s something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.</p>
<p>This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. <strong>Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants.</strong> And once you go down that route, you&#x27;re lost.</p>
<h2 id="planning-or-no-planning-" node="[object Object]">Planning or no planning?</h2>
<p>But while you need boldness, you don&#x27;t usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.</p>
<p>The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can&#x27;t discover natural selection that way.</p>
<p>I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach &quot;staying upwind.&quot; This is how most people who&#x27;ve done great work seem to have done it.</p>
<p>The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you&#x27;re going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say &quot;we&#x27;re going to do x and then y and then z&quot; than &quot;we&#x27;re going to try x and see what happens.&quot; And it is more organized; it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.</p>
<p>Planning per se isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s sometimes necessary, but it&#x27;s a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It&#x27;s something you have to do because you&#x27;re working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don&#x27;t have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.</p>
<p>Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that&#x27;s been done before, <strong>you&#x27;ll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff.</strong> And you&#x27;ll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-setbacks" node="[object Object]">Dealing with setbacks</h2>
<p>You don&#x27;t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there&#x27;s a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.</p>
<p>For example, while you must work hard, it&#x27;s possible to work too hard, and if you do that you&#x27;ll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn&#x27;t. When I&#x27;m reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying &quot;I&#x27;ll just read over what I&#x27;ve got so far.&quot; Five minutes later I&#x27;ve found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I&#x27;m off.</p>
<p>Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It&#x27;s ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying &quot;How hard could it be?&quot;</p>
<p>Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.</p>
<p>Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you&#x27;re working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all.</p>
<h2 id="procrastination" node="[object Object]">Procrastination</h2>
<p>Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. <strong>Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous.</strong> You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn&#x27;t quite right. When you&#x27;re procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done.</p>
<p>One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You&#x27;re not just sitting around doing nothing; you&#x27;re working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn&#x27;t set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You&#x27;re too busy to notice it.</p>
<p>The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you&#x27;re young it&#x27;s ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older.</p>
<p>Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. <strong>You can&#x27;t think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high.</strong> You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it&#x27;s happening.</p>
<h2 id="power-of-compounding-growth" node="[object Object]">Power of compounding growth</h2>
<p>There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you&#x27;re genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you&#x27;re surprised how far you&#x27;ve come.</p>
<p>The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can&#x27;t grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.</p>
<p>Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it&#x27;s worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.</p>
<h2 id="setting-aims-for-your-project" node="[object Object]">Setting aims for your project</h2>
<p>One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries&#x27;, but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.</p>
<p>What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you&#x27;re trying to seem a certain way as you&#x27;re doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That&#x27;s one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that&#x27;s basically the definition of a nerd.</p>
<p>Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that&#x27;s exactly what you need in doing great work. It&#x27;s not learned; it&#x27;s preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. &quot;It&#x27;s easy to criticize&quot; is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.</p>
<h2 id="develop-a-taste" node="[object Object]">Develop a taste</h2>
<p>Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re aiming for.</p>
<p>And that is what you&#x27;re aiming for, because if you don&#x27;t try to be the best, you won&#x27;t even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it&#x27;s true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.</p>
<p>Fortunately there&#x27;s a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you&#x27;d be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It&#x27;s exciting, and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it&#x27;s easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.</p>
<p>Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It&#x27;s usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.</p>
<p>You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won&#x27;t necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there&#x27;s something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I&#x27;d already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?</p>
<p>Have the confidence to cut. Don&#x27;t keep something that doesn&#x27;t fit just because you&#x27;re proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t divide your attention evenly between many topics though, or you&#x27;ll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law. <strong>Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.</strong></p>
<h2 id="be-confortable-with-discomfort" node="[object Object]">Be confortable with discomfort</h2>
<p>Think about what&#x27;s happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you&#x27;re willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don&#x27;t want to solve them.</p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.</p>
<p>Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, try, try again&quot; isn&#x27;t quite right. It should be: If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.</p>
<p>&quot;Never give up&quot; is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it&#x27;s the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.</p>
<h2 id="putting-everything-together" node="[object Object]">Putting everything together</h2>
<p><strong>Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what&#x27;s worth paying attention to.</strong></p>
<p>Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.</p>
<p>Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that, you&#x27;d fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question.</p>
<p>Yes, you&#x27;ll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard. And if you&#x27;re working on something you find very interesting, which you necessarily will if you&#x27;re on the right path, the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your peers&#x27;.</p>
<p><strong>The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?</strong></p>
